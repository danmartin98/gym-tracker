## Project Diary

#####- 08/02/2022
  - We have set this project up as a way of honing our development skills further and practice working using the Agile methodology. We started a few weeks ago and set up a Trello board to start defining our steps and assigning ourselves relevant actions. We have since been meeting two to three times per week, for about an hour at a time, to assess the situation and define the next steps.
  - First step was to define what our interface would look like, by completing both lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes (using https://wireframe.cc/ and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)), then we proceeded with setting up the backend. After that was done, we started defining what our components in React would be and how to best split up the logic. At the same time, we started looking into frontend frameworks for the styling. 
  - __Work in progress__
